## The story of a little bean

**Once upon a time**, there was a small red bean named _Redy_, growing in the village of RedBeans, who was loved by everyone. 
The little red bean lives on the side of the road.   Everyday, the people walking by carry _Redy_ on a daily walk in the village.  
 
  > I have travelled so many times.
  >> I am so glad there are many people to take me on a walk.

     Says Redy.
